#CharLimit for [Brackets.io](https://github.com/adobe/brackets)



## Known Issues

If [Interactive Linter](https://github.com/MiguelCastillo/Brackets-Interactive-Linter) is also installed, on the first load, the line can be too far to the left if there are any lint messages because the interactive linter gutter hasn't loaded.
