#CharLimit for [Brackets.io](https://github.com/adobe/brackets)

Draws a gray line at 80 characters. May not be visible in some themes.

Not yet implemented: ability to adjust the line to a different value than 80 characters.

## Known Issues

If [Interactive Linter](https://github.com/MiguelCastillo/Brackets-Interactive-Linter) is also installed, on the first load, the line is too far to the left because the interactive linter gutter hasn't loaded.
