#CharLimit for [Brackets.io](https://github.com/adobe/brackets)

Draws a line at a specified column number.

To access settings, go to Edit->CharLimit Preferences.

The default settings are 80 characters, #bbbbbb for the line color, and the line is enabled.

## Known Issues

If [Interactive Linter](https://github.com/MiguelCastillo/Brackets-Interactive-Linter) is also installed, on the first load, the line can be too far to the left if there are any lint messages because the interactive linter gutter hasn't loaded.
